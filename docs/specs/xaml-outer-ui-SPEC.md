# Spec: Afterhours UI in Uno XAML around a JavaScript room

Status: **draft v2; waves 0 and 1 done, wave 2 next.** Rewritten 2026-10-23 after the migration-scope review.
No app code changed yet.

## Settled inputs

| Input | Answer | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Targets | **Web only** (`net10.0-browserwasm`) | user, 2026-10-23 |
| Solo play | **Keep.** Browser-saved game, simulated residents, no server, standalone `Afterhours.html` | user, 2026-10-23 |
| Room renderer | **Stays JavaScript.** A SkiaSharp port pays off only with desktop/Android | scope review + user |
| Synth | **Stays JavaScript** (`music.js`, WebAudio). Uno has no synthesis or scheduling API | scope review |
| Game server | **JS Worker stays.** Staged order: Phase A over JS state, Phase B ports rules to C# with shared test cases (scope review's Option 1), ASP.NET Core later if the playtest outgrows five players | recommendation; confirm in Unresolved Questions |

## Goal and phases

The Uno app owns every screen the player reads or types into: menus, HUD, chat, panels, and the room-editor
toolbar. The isometric room canvas, the arcade rounds, the synth and the account widgets stay JavaScript.
They run as **DOM islands** inside the Uno page, with no iframe.

| Phase | Delivers | Game state owner | This spec |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | `BrowserHtmlElement` room host, XAML shell, every panel in XAML + MVUX | JS `Game` (`game-core.js`), read through C# interfaces | **full detail** |
| **B** | `Afterhours.Core` C# rules + shared test cases; C# solo store; C# shared-world client | C# for the client; JS Worker on the server | outline only; own spec before build |
| C | ASP.NET Core server sharing `Afterhours.Core` | C# everywhere | out of scope |

The panels bind to interfaces (`IGameStore`, `ISharedWorld`, `IRoomView`, `IMusic`). Phase A implements the
first two over JS. Phase B swaps in C# implementations without touching XAML.

Evidence: `dist/*.js` (every panel, inventoried below), `session-core.mjs` (imports `game-core.js` and
`furniture.js`), `service/scripts/build.mjs` (also bundles `wardrobe.js`), `online.js` (`W.game.dispatch`
override: dispatches on the client, then the server re-runs it), Uno docs (`interop/wasm-javascript-1`,
`features/using-skia-hosting-native-controls`, `controls/SKCanvasElement`, `controls/WebView`), Uno 6.7.135 package source.

---

## Architecture Brief

### Targets, SDK and features

- `net10.0-browserwasm`, **native (DOM) renderer**: `SkiaRenderer` stays off. XAML and the JS islands share
  one DOM, so XAML flyouts stack over the room in normal z-order, with alpha blending.
- Uno.Sdk **6.7.30**, pinned in `uno/global.json`.
- `UnoFeatures`: `Hosting; MVUX; Navigation; Toolkit` (all new). The WebView is removed; `AfterhoursInterop.js`
  and its Node test are deleted.

### Decisions

**D1. Host the game DOM with `BrowserHtmlElement` instead of `WebView2`.**
Reason: the Uno docs document `Uno.UI.NativeElementHosting.BrowserHtmlElement` for WebAssembly. Same-page
hosting removes the iframe, the Uno 6.7/.NET 10 `unoExports` shim, iframe user-activation limits on audio,
and iframe focus handoff. C# and JS call each other through `[JSImport]`/`[JSExport]`.
Tradeoff: game CSS and globals share the page with Uno. CSS gets scoped under `.ah-root` (D5), and window key
handlers must ignore events from XAML (D6).

**D2. Phase A keeps the JS `Game` as the single writer of game state.**
Reason: `online.js` dispatches each action on the client and then sends it to the server, which runs it again.
A C# client copy has to match the JS server exactly or shared players see changes snap back. That port deserves
its own phase with shared test cases (Phase B). The panels gain nothing from waiting for it.
Tradeoff: in Phase A, C# reads state the game pushes, and every write is a call into JS.

**D3. The panels bind to four C# interfaces.**
Reason: they are the seam Phase B swaps. `IGameStore` (solo rules state and the 22 actions) and `ISharedWorld`
(connection and shared snapshot) get C# implementations later. `IRoomView` (renderer) and `IMusic` (synth)
stay JS-backed permanently.
Tradeoff: about 30 C# records mirror the JS state shape, which `validate()` in `game-core.js` defines.

**D4. MVUX models, Navigation `!` routes, one persistent `MainPage`.**
Reason: the store pushes async state with real Progress/Error cases. Each panel has one editable draft (an
`IState`). The room host must never be navigated away, because that would drop the live room, audio and
online session. Panels open as flyouts or dialogs over `MainPage`.
Tradeoff: Uno.Extensions + Toolkit add download size and build time (R7).

**D5. Scope game CSS under `.ah-root` at build time.**
`scripts/scope-css.mjs` (no dependency, built in wave 0) prefixes every selector with `.ah-root`, turns
`:root`, `html` and `body` into the root itself, recurses into `@media`/`@supports`, and hoists `@import`,
`@font-face` and `@keyframes`. `scripts/build-uno.mjs` writes the result to `game/scoped.css`. The JS writes its `body` classes (`is-playing`, `chat-history-open`, `music-panel-open`) to the root
element instead. `npm start` keeps loading the unscoped files.
Tradeoff: a build transform to test. Unscoped `*{box-sizing}`, `button{}`, `input{}` and `dialog{}` rules
would otherwise restyle Uno's own DOM.

**D6. DOM islands for JS-only surfaces.**
Each JS surface mounts into its own `BrowserHtmlElement`: the room canvas (`RoomHost`), an arcade round
(`ArcadeHost`, using `AfterhoursArcade.start(kind, host, done)`), and the Turnstile check (`CaptchaHost`, R9).
Window key handlers in `app.js`/`arcade.js` act only while focus is inside `.ah-root` or the arcade host.

**D7. The room asks the XAML to open panels.**
Canvas interactions that open panels today (furniture use, residents, players, jukebox, portals, message
board, set complete, the doorbell) send `open {route, data}` through `IRoomView.Requests`. `MainModel` navigates.

### Shell and regions

```
App.xaml.cs  UseToolkitNavigation · RegisterRoutes · NavigateAsync<Shell>
Shell (UserControl, plain ContentControl host; no ExtendedSplashScreen, see wave 0; no Region.Attached)
└─ MainPage   Grid[Region.Attached]        rows: TopBar | Body ; Body columns: Rail | Stage | Social
   ├─ TopBar     brand · Music · Furniture shop · coins · profile MenuFlyout
   ├─ Rail       nav · room hopping · resident card          Wide+: 220 px · Normal: 72 px icons · Narrow: hidden
   ├─ Stage      RoomHeading · RoomHost (BrowserHtmlElement) · EditorBar | ActionBar · NowPlaying
   ├─ Social     ChatPanel (Room chat / Friends tabs)       Wide+: column · below: !Chat flyout
   ├─ BottomBar  utu:TabBar                                   Narrow only
   └─ BootPanel  covers Stage until IRoomView reports Ready
```

### Services (DI)

| Interface | Phase A implementation | Phase B | Members (abridged) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `IGameStore` | `JsGameStore` | `CoreGameStore` (C#, `localStorage` via JSImport) | `IFeed<GameState> State`; `ValueTask<ActionResult> Dispatch(GameAction, ct)` for the 22 actions; `SaveDraft(SongDraft)`; `Export()`/`Restore(GameState)`/`RestoreBackup()` |
| `ISharedWorld` | `JsSharedWorld` (wraps `online.js`) | `HttpSharedWorld` | `IFeed<SharedState> State` (None when solo); `Connect(JoinRequest)`, `Leave`, `JoinRoom(key)`, `Say`, `Whisper`, `Friend`, `Trade*`, `Vote`, `Queue`, `Report`, `AwaySeen` |
| `IRoomView` | `JsRoomView` | same | `Mount(elementId)`, `IFeed<RoomInfo> Room`, `IFeed<EditorState> Editor`, `IListFeed<ChatLine> Chat`, `IAsyncEnumerable<OpenRequest> Requests`; `Enter(RoomKey)`, `Wave`, `Dance`, `Stand`, `StartEditing`/`Rotate`/`Store`/`Undo`/`Finish`/`Select(itemId)`, `Zoom(in/out/fit/follow)`, `Say(text, mode)`, `Focus()` |
| `IMusic` | `JsMusic` | same | `IFeed<Playback> Playback` (running, songId, step); `Play(SongDraft)`, `Stop`, `ExportWav(SongDraft)` (download handled in JS) |
| `GameHost` (static partial) | — | — | the only `[JSImport]`/`[JSExport]` surface; module `game/host.mjs` via `JSHost.ImportAsync` |

`game/host.mjs` (ES module, prototyped in wave 0) loads the classic game scripts in today's `index.html` order,
builds the room markup inside the mounted element, sets `window.AfterhoursBase` so game art resolves under
`game/`, and exposes the JS half of the four interfaces. It pushes **state slices** (`profile`, `wallet`,
`items`, `rooms`, `songs`, `draft`, `pet`, `progress`, …: the top-level keys of `game.state`), sending only the
slices whose JSON changed, at most 10/s. It also pushes `shared`, `room`, `editor`, `chat`, `playback` and
`open`. Wave 0 measured a full 212 KB save at 20–42 ms per C# parse, which is too slow to send whole (R8). The `world` facade it calls is today's `window.AfterhoursWorld`, extended where needed.
`BridgeJsonContext` (`System.Text.Json` source generation) keeps parsing trimming-safe.

### Routes

```csharp
views.Register(
    new ViewMap(ViewModel: typeof(ShellModel)),
    new ViewMap<MainPage, MainModel>(),
    // one ViewMap or DataViewMap per panel in the table below
);
routes.Register(new RouteMap("", View: views.FindByViewModel<ShellModel>(), Nested:
[
    new RouteMap("Main", View: views.FindByViewModel<MainModel>(), IsDefault: true),
    // one RouteMap per panel, all opened from Main with "!"
]));
```

### Panel inventory (Phase A)

Each row is a `!` route opened over `MainPage`, shown as a right flyout (F) or a dialog (D). The source column
names the JS function it replaces; that JS is deleted when the row ships.

| Wave | Route | Kind | Model data | Replaces |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | `Shop` | F | — | `catalog` "THE FURNITURE SHOP" |
| 2 | `Inventory` | F | — | `showInventory` |
| 2 | `CollectionItem` | D | `CatalogEntry` | `catalog` item "THE AFTERHOURS COLLECTION" |
| 2 | `Blueprints` | F | — | `blueprints` |
| 2 | `WrapGift` | D | `ItemId` | gift panel "WRAP A GIFT" |
| 3 | `Studio` | F | — | `studio` (Editor / Library tabs) |
| 3 | `DeleteSong` | D | `SongId` | "Delete this track?" |
| 3 | `Stage` | F | — | `stagePanel` (solo) and shared stage "SHARED MUSIC STAGE" |
| 3 | `SetComplete` | D | `SetResult` | "SET COMPLETE" |
| 3 | `Jukebox` | F | `RoomId` | `playlistPanel` |
| 3 | `Chart` | F | — | `chartPanel` |
| 4 | `Wardrobe` | F | — | `look` + `classicLook` |
| 4 | `Profile` | F | — | `profile` |
| 4 | `RestoreSave` | D | `GameState` | "Restore this world?" / "Recover your last backup" |
| 4 | `Journal` | F | — | `journal` (quests, daily gift, badges) |
| 4 | `Help` | F | — | "HOW TO PLAY" + first-visit welcome |
| 5 | `Rooms` | F | `RoomFilter` | `directory` + shared `roomDirectory` |
| 5 | `CreateRoom` | D | — | "CREATE A ROOM" |
| 5 | `RoomTools` | F | `RoomId` | `roomTools` + "ROOM SETTINGS" |
| 5 | `RoomLogic` | F | `RoomId` | `rulesPanel` |
| 5 | `RoomEvent` | D | `RoomId` | `eventPanel` |
| 5 | `MessageBoard` | F | `RoomId` | `notesPanel` |
| 5 | `Portal` | D | `ItemId` | "LINK A PORTAL" |
| 5 | `RoomObject` | D | `ItemId` | `openObject` / `itemDetails` "ROOM INTERACTION" |
| 5 | `Companion` | F | — | `petPanel` + "ADOPT A COMPANION" |
| 5 | `Arcade` | F | `ArcadeKind?` | `arcade` (picker in XAML; round in `ArcadeHost` island) |
| 6 | `Friends` | F | — | "YOUR CIRCLE" + shared `friendsPanel` |
| 6 | `Resident` | D | `ResidentId` | `residentProfile` |
| 6 | `Player` | D | `PlayerId` | `playerPanel` "CONNECTED PLAYER" |
| 6 | `Report` | D | `PlayerId` | "Report a player" |
| 6 | `Trade` | F | `TradeId?` | `tradePanel` |
| 6 | `Away` | D | — | `awayPanel` |
| 6 | `SharedWorld` | F | — | "SHARED WORLD" / "SHARED SESSIONS" info |
| 6 | `ChatPrefs` | D | — | "CHAT PREFERENCES" |
| 6 | `Chat` | F | — | chat column on narrow widths |
| 7 | `Join` / `Restore` / `SignOut` | D | — | account panels (Turnstile in `CaptchaHost`, Supabase JS unchanged) — **R9 gated** |

Wave 1 has no routes: it builds `MainPage` (top bar, rail, room heading, action bar, editor bar, now playing,
chat column) and the four interfaces.

### Models (pattern; one per route)

- **Read side:** derived feeds from the store, e.g. `ShopModel.Items = Store.State.Select(Catalog.ForSale)`.
  A record with `Id` gets key equality for free.
- **Write side:** public methods call `Store.Dispatch(new BuyAction(type))` and show the returned error
  inline. They never edit state locally.
- **Drafts:** `IState<T>` local to the panel (wardrobe outfit, studio song, profile form, room form, trade offer).
  Seeded once from the store when the panel opens, and committed by one command.
- `StudioModel.Draft` also saves through `Store.SaveDraft` (debounced 300 ms). The playhead comes from
  `IMusic.Playback` and moves one overlay element, so step cells never rebuild per tick.
- `WardrobeModel.Preview` = Combine(Draft, Pose).SelectAsync(`IRoomView.RenderAvatar`) → PNG data URL.
  `avatar-renderer.js` keeps the pixel tinting (scope review question 3: yes, through the bridge).

### Phase B outline (own spec before building)

1. **Shared test cases:** `tests/vectors/*.json` hold `{state, action, now, expect: {state | error}}` for all
   22 actions, `validate`, and day/ISO-week rollovers. `node --test` runs them against `game-core.js` today.
2. **`Afterhours.Core`:** C# records + a reducer + `Validate` + furniture catalog + wardrobe tables. An xUnit
   project runs the same vectors, and CI fails if either side diverges.
3. **`CoreGameStore`** for solo, reading and writing the same `afterhours-v5` save. Existing players keep
   their worlds.
4. **`HttpSharedWorld`:** the C# client for the Worker API (`/api/*`), with the optimistic dispatch done by
   `Afterhours.Core`.
5. `movement.js` and `seating.js` stay with the JS renderer; the server only checks movement distance.
   Delete the JS client copies of `game-core`/`furniture`/`wardrobe` only once they leave the server too (Phase C).

### Platform constraints

- `localStorage` keys stay as they are (`afterhours`, `afterhours-v5`, `-backup`, `-online-cache`,
  `afterhours-account-resume`). Phase A changes no save format.
- Downloads (save export, WAV) stay JS `a.download`. File import uses the XAML `FileOpenPicker` on WASM (R10),
  then calls `IGameStore.Restore`.
- OAuth redirect stays on `account-callback.html`.
- `npm start` and `Afterhours.html` keep the full JS UI until the end of Phase A. After that, whether to keep
  the JS panels for the standalone build is an Unresolved Question.

### Testing and validation

- `npm test` stays green after every wave. New tests:
  - `tests/test-host.cjs`: host.mjs script order, mount into a given element, event throttling, `open` requests.
  - `tests/test-scope-css.mjs`: no unscoped selector in the scoped output; keyframes and font-face hoisted
    (wave 0 proved it in the browser: no rule in `scoped.css` matches any Uno element).
- **C# tests:** a new `uno/Afterhours.Uno.Tests` (xUnit, `net10.0`) for record parsing (`BridgeJsonContext`
  against a captured `game.state`), model filtering (rooms, shop) and the studio undo stack. Phase B adds
  the vector runner here.
- **Runtime:** Playwright (Chromium, `/opt/pw-browsers`) against `npm run start:uno` at 1440, 1000, 800 and
  390 px, one script per wave. Each script covers every route in that wave: open, change, commit, reload,
  confirm persisted. Solo and shared both run, using the two-tab check from `PLAYTEST-SETUP.md`. Screenshots
  go to `docs/screenshots/`.
- `verify-uno.mjs` checks `game/host.mjs` and the scoped CSS in the publish output, and that no WebView
  remains in the publish output.

### Capability inventory

| Capability | Status | Choice |
|---|---|---|
| Menus, HUD, rail, room hopping, resident card | implemented | XAML (wave 1) |
| Room heading, action bar (wave, dance, stand, dock), now playing | implemented | XAML (wave 1) |
| Room-editor toolbar | implemented | XAML → `IRoomView` (wave 1) |
| Zoom/fit/follow, sound toggle, seat status, toasts | **omitted** (stay JS) | scene overlays drawn over the canvas |
| Chat column: room chat, shout/whisper modes, history | implemented | XAML ← `IRoomView.Chat` (wave 1) |
| Speech bubbles, arrival cues, room intro card | **omitted** (stay JS) | drawn on the canvas |
| The 35 panels in waves 2–6 of the inventory | implemented | XAML routes |

| C# rules, C# shared client | **deferred** | Phase B |
| Desktop/Android heads, SkiaSharp renderer | **omitted** | web only |

---

## Design Brief

- **Direction:** keep today's look: midnight surfaces, one acid accent, a condensed display face. XAML
  should be indistinguishable from the current CSS at a glance. Refinements come later through
  `gold-standard-pass`.
- **Theme:** keep Fluent `XamlControlsResources` (the project's theme). Dark only, because the CSS
  declares `color-scheme: dark` with no light palette. Controls are tuned with Fluent lightweight keys
  (`Button*`, `ToggleButton*`, `TextControl*`, `FlyoutPresenter*`, `ContentDialog*`, `Pivot*`).

### Tokens (`Themes/Tokens.xaml`, merged in App.xaml; values from `dist/style.css :root`)

| Key | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `SurfaceBaseBrush` | `#14141B` | page, room backdrop |
| `SurfacePanelBrush` | `#1C1C25` | rail, chat, flyouts |
| `SurfaceRaisedBrush` | `? pending`, from `.directory-room` / `.furniture-card` CSS in wave 1 | cards, chips, step cells |
| `LineBrush` | `#FFFFFF0C` | dividers, strokes |
| `InkBrush` | `#F3F1E9` | primary text |
| `MutedBrush` | `#92929F` | secondary text (6.3:1 on base) |
| `AcidBrush` | `#DFED8C` | accent fill, active state, focus |
| `OnAcidBrush` | `#14141B` | text on acid |
| `ChatColor0..7` | `G.chatColors` | name blocks in chat |

- **Type ramp** (`Themes/Type.xaml`): `DisplayText` Barlow Condensed SemiBold 34 · `TitleText` DM Sans Bold 18 ·
  `BodyText` DM Sans 13 · `LabelText` DM Sans Bold 13 · `EyebrowText` Space Grotesk Medium 10 caps,
  CharacterSpacing 150 (R6) · `NumeralText` DM Sans Bold, tabular. No literal `FontSize` in pages.
- **Fonts:** `Assets/Fonts/DMSans_Regular.ttf`, `DMSans_Bold.ttf`, `BarlowCondensed_SemiBold.ttf`,
  `SpaceGrotesk_Medium.ttf`: static, underscore names, OFL. The game's Google Fonts `@import` stays for the
  JS islands.
- **Spacing/radii:** 4-pt steps; radii 8 (chips, cells), 12 (cards), 16 (flyouts).
- **Scopes:** tokens, type and control keys in App.xaml. Templates live in their page's resources. Templates
  shared by several panels (`ItemCardTemplate`, `SongCardTemplate`, `RoomCardTemplate`, `PersonRowTemplate`)
  live in `Themes/Templates.xaml`.
- **Art in XAML:** furniture, room and avatar art come from `game/assets/*.webp` by URL. Furniture cards
  crop atlas cells using the crop tables `host.mjs` exports (`furnitureCrops`, `newCrops`, collector JSON),
  in a clipped container with a `TranslateTransform`. Avatars and portraits use PNGs that
  `IRoomView.RenderAvatar` returns.
- **Adaptive** (`utu:ResponsiveLayout` app-wide: Narrow 700 / Normal 960 / Wide 1200 / Widest 1600, matching the CSS):
  - Wide+: rail 220 · chat column 300 · flyouts 480 (lists), 760 (wardrobe), 1040 (studio, capped at 92%).
  - Normal: rail 72 icons · chat as `!Chat` flyout.
  - Narrow: rail and chat hidden · bottom `utu:TabBar` (Explore, My room, Studio, Chat, More) · flyouts full-screen.
  - Responsive values sit on elements, with fixed columns, per the house rule.
- **Overlay note:** on the native renderer, translucent XAML over the room blends normally. On the Skia
  renderer, native elements do not alpha-blend (Uno docs), so translucent overlays over the room would need
  to become opaque. This matters only if the renderer ever switches.

## Interaction Brief

### Core flows (route sequences)

1. **Boot:** BootPanel → `GameHost.Load` → `IRoomView.Mount(RoomHost.Id)` → `Ready` → BootPanel hides.
   Over 15 s or on a script error → Error state with Retry, which reloads the page.
2. **Shop:** TopBar "Furniture shop" → `!Shop` → item → `!CollectionItem` → Buy → `Dispatch(Buy)` → close both →
   `IRoomView.Select(itemId)` places it (editor bar appears).
3. **Studio:** Rail "Beat studio" → `!Studio` (Editor) → steps, tempo, pack → Play (playhead) → Save → Library →
   Perform → `-` → `!Stage`.
4. **Look:** Rail "My look" → `!Wardrobe` → parts, colours, pose → Save → `Dispatch(Outfit)` → `-`.
5. **Explore:** Rail "Explore" / room hopping "All rooms" → `!Rooms` → filter, search → card →
   `IRoomView.Enter` (solo) or `ISharedWorld.JoinRoom` (shared; doorbell → "Ringing…", flyout stays) → `-`.
6. **Room-initiated:** click jukebox / resident / player / portal / board → `IRoomView.Requests` → `MainModel`
   navigates `!Jukebox`, `!Resident`, and so on, with the data.
7. **Chat:** type in the chat box → Enter → `IRoomView.Say(text, mode)` → bubble drawn on canvas + line in the list.

### Input and focus

- Tab order: TopBar → Rail → RoomHost → ActionBar → Chat. Room keys (arrows/WASD, 1/2, R, Space-drag) work
  while `RoomHost` has focus.
- When a flyout closes or a room is entered, focus returns through `IRoomView.Focus()`. Clicking the room
  focuses it, as today.
- Studio board: arrows move between cells, Enter/Space toggles, Ctrl+Z undoes, P plays.
- Esc closes the top flyout or dialog (Navigation default).

### Async states (applies to every panel)

| Node | Value | Progress | None | Error |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MainModel.Hud` | top bar + rail | coins "—", skeleton rail | n/a: a ready game always has state | BootPanel Error + Retry |
| list panels (Shop, Inventory, Rooms, Songs, Friends, Chart, Board, Blueprints) | items | skeleton cards ×4 | panel-specific copy from today's JS (e.g. "No rooms match this search.") | inline banner + Retry |
| `SharedState` consumers | shared UI | "Connecting…" | solo view (shared sections hidden) | "Shared world unavailable" + Retry; solo keeps working |
| `Wardrobe.Preview` | image | last image dimmed 40% | n/a | last good image + "Preview unavailable" |
| any `Dispatch` | close / refresh | command disabled + verb label ("Buying…") | n/a | `InfoBar` with the game's own message (`e.message`) |

### Visual states and colour cues

Nav item Selected: acid bar **plus** bold label. Step cell On: acid fill **plus** centre dot; Current:
outline ring. Swatch Selected: ring **plus** check glyph. Owned item: "Owned" text **plus** dim price.
Toggle (mute, solo, favourite): acid **plus** glyph swap. No state rides on colour alone.

### Motion

- Flyouts: Toolkit drawer default. Reduced motion: plain presenter with no transition (R5).
- Preview and portrait swap: 120 ms fade (`Motion.Fast`, EaseOut). Reduced: instant.
- Playhead: snaps per step with no tween. Coin change: no animation (numerals are tabular, so the width holds).

### Accessibility

- `AutomationProperties.Name` on every icon-only control. Step cells read "Kick step 5, on", swatches read
  their colour name, room cards read "Side B, public room, 6 people".
- Chat list is a live region (`AutomationProperties.LiveSetting="Polite"`), matching today's `aria-live`.
- Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 for Ink/Muted on Base/Panel; OnAcid on Acid ≥ 12:1. Fluent focus visuals kept.

### Runtime verification (per wave)

Playwright on WASM at four widths. Per route: open, act, verify the store change (coins, item counts, saved
track, outfit after reload), Esc returns focus to the room. Shared: two tabs, chat round trip, applause pays,
doorbell. Screenshots per route in `docs/screenshots/xaml/`.

## Wave 0 results (2026-10-23)

**Verdict: go for wave 1.** Same-page hosting works on Uno 6.7.135's native WebAssembly renderer. The WebView
fallback is not needed. Evidence: `docs/spikes/wave0/` (screenshots, `results.json`, the 212 KB max save),
produced by `scripts/spike-wave0.mjs` in Chromium with `--autoplay-policy=user-gesture-required` against a
trimmed Release publish.

| Check | Result | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| R1 hosting | PASS | 15 classic game scripts load into a `BrowserHtmlElement` beside Uno's `require.js`; ready in ~5 s cold; no page errors |
| R1 round trip | PASS | XAML button → `[JSImport] dispatch('checkin')` → JS game → state event → `[JSImport]` callback → XAML text: 240 → 275 ✦ |
| R2 overlay | PASS | plain XAML `Flyout` and a Navigation `!SpikePanel` page both draw over the live canvas, take clicks, light-dismiss, Esc closes; translucent acrylic blends over the canvas |
| R2 JS dialogs | PASS | unmigrated `<dialog>` panels still open and close from the hosted game |
| R3 CSS scope | PASS | no rule in `game/scoped.css` matches any element outside `.ah-root` |
| R4 keys | PASS | typing `wasd` and arrows into a XAML `TextBox` leaves the avatar still; after clicking the room, arrows walk |
| Audio | PASS | a click on a XAML button starts the game's `AudioContext` (`running`) under the real autoplay policy |
| R6 fonts | PASS | `ms-appx:///Assets/Fonts/DMSans_Regular.ttf#DM Sans` loads (Uno registers it under a generated family name); `CharacterSpacing="150"` renders as `letter-spacing: 2.7px` at 18 px |
| R7 size | measured | `_framework` brotli 5.53 MB → **6.49 MB (+0.96 MB, +17%)** with `Hosting; Toolkit; MVUX; Navigation`; cold Release build 159 s (baseline 187 s on a colder cache); Windows `--in-process` path not checked here |
| R7 warnings | **new** | 17 × IL2026 + 3 × IL2104 trim warnings, from Uno.Extensions Navigation/Toolkit and MVUX-generated view models (hot-reload patching, `dynamic`). The trimmed app runs every check correctly |
| R8 state volume | **FAIL as designed** | fresh save 2.2 KB parses in 2.5–3.9 ms; the max save (212 KB) takes **20–42 ms** per `JsonDocument.Parse` on the UI thread → push changed slices instead (Services section updated) |
| Art | fixed in spike | game art loaded by relative path 404'd in the Uno page; `window.AfterhoursBase` now prefixes every JS asset path (standalone packager still embeds all 18 images) |

**Workarounds found** (each marked in code; candidates for the uno-scaffolding runtime gotchas):

- `WORKAROUND(BrowserHtmlElement inherits pointer-events none on the native renderer)`: Uno 6.7.135 sets
  `pointer-events: none` on the hosting `ContentControl`/`ContentPresenter`, which the hosted `<div>`
  inherits, so the canvas never receives clicks. `InputPolicy = NativeOnly` does not change this on the
  native renderer. Fix: `SetCssStyle(("pointer-events", "auto"))` on the element (`Interop/RoomHost.cs`).
- Toolkit `ExtendedSplashScreen` requests a lowercase `appmanifest.js` on WebAssembly. The project ships
  `AppManifest.js`, so case-sensitive hosts (the Node server, Cloudflare) return 404. The Shell uses a plain
  `ContentControl`, and `MainPage` keeps its own loading panel.
- Build: publishing over an existing `release/uno` kept the previous `dotnet.*.js` in the new package's
  `uno-config.js`, so a rebuilt app silently served the old assembly. `build-uno.mjs` now empties the folder
  first (commit `eafc1f9`).

## Wave 1 results (2026-10-23)

**Done: XAML chrome around the JavaScript room.** 30/30 runtime checks (`scripts/verify-wave1.mjs`,
screenshots in `docs/screenshots/xaml/wave1/`) at 1440/1000/800/390 px, solo and two-player shared;
72 Node tests and 9 xUnit tests pass; the publish passes the warning gate.

What shipped: top bar (brand, shared-world status, shop, credits, portrait), rail (nav, room hopping with a
current-room bar, resident card with XP and daily gift, help), room heading, the room in a `BrowserHtmlElement`,
editor bar, action bar and dock, now playing, chat column / chat flyout with Say/Shout/Whisper, phone bottom
bar, and a boot `FeedView` with reload on error. The WebView, `AfterhoursInterop.js` and its test are gone.

Decisions made while building (they amend the briefs above):

- **Strangler bridge.** `host.mjs` reports what the game's own chrome shows (HUD via game-core's rules, room,
  editor, actions, now playing, chat, portrait) and runs XAML commands by clicking the game's own buttons
  through an allowlist (`commands`). No game logic is repeated in C#. Later waves delete each JS piece as its
  XAML replacement lands. An xUnit test checks every XAML `CommandParameter` against the allowlist.
- **Interfaces on demand.** Wave 1 needed `IGameStore` (HUD, portrait, slices) and `IRoomView` (status, chrome,
  chat, rooms, commands). `IMusic` arrives with the studio (wave 3) and `ISharedWorld` with rooms/social (waves 5–6).
- **Scene overlays stay in the room.** Zoom/fit/follow, the sound toggle, the room intro card, seat status and
  toasts are drawn over the canvas by the game and stay there (capability row updated).
- **Shared templates later.** No template is shared yet, so `Themes/Templates.xaml` waits for wave 2.
- **Fonts.** DM Sans Regular and Bold, Barlow Condensed ExtraBold (room titles, uppercase with an acid stop),
  Space Grotesk Bold (brand), matching the CSS weights.
- **Warning gate.** The approved "no warnings beyond the recorded set" is enforced by class, not count:
  `scripts/uno-warnings.mjs` allows IL2026 from MVUX-generated view models and Uno.Extensions APIs and IL2104
  from Uno assemblies (52 + 3 today; the count grows with each model). Any other warning fails `npm run build:uno`.
- **Chat command shape.** `Send(text, mode, whisperTarget)`: `text` is the command parameter (Enter passes
  `TextBox.Text`; the button passes it by `ElementName`), the other two resolve from MVUX states.

## Implementation Plan

**Wave 0: prototype and spikes. Done 2026-10-23, verdict go** (see Wave 0 results). The spike code
(`MainPage` spike bar, `SpikePanel` route) is replaced in wave 1; `host.mjs`, `scope-css.mjs`, `RoomHost`,
`GameHost` and the asset base carry forward.

**Wave 1: foundation.** UnoFeatures, hosting, navigation, `GameHost` + `host.mjs`, the four `Js*`
implementations, tokens, fonts, templates, and the full MainPage (top bar, rail, heading, action bar, editor
bar, now playing, chat). Delete the WebView, `AfterhoursInterop.js` and `test-uno-bridge.cjs`. Add
`Afterhours.Uno.Tests`.

**Waves 2–7:** one wave per row group in the panel inventory. Each wave: XAML routes + models, delete the
replaced JS panel code, forward its JS entry points to `open` requests, then tests + Playwright + commit.

**Wave 8: docs.** README Uno section, RELEASE-NOTES, PLAYTEST-SETUP (re-run the five-player acceptance on the
XAML build), screenshots. Then write the Phase B spec.

Each wave is one or more conventional commits on its own branch, merged only with CI green.

## Quality Gates

| Phase | Gate (skill) | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| every wave | Build + tests | `npm test` green; `npm run build:uno` with no warnings beyond the 20 recorded Extensions/MVUX trim warnings; xUnit green; CI green |
| waves 1–7 | `uno-verify` (Playwright on WASM; App MCP n/a for this head) | every touched route exercised at 4 widths, solo and shared |
| waves 2–7 | `uno-component-states` | Progress/None/Error per the table; Retry proven by failing the store |
| waves 1–7 | `uno-build-log` | entry per wave in `docs/fleet/BUILD-LOG.md` |
| end of each wave | `uno-completeness-audit` scoped to that wave's routes | gaps listed with evidence |
| wave 8 | `uno-break-it`, then `gold-standard-pass`, then `uno-audit` | findings fixed or listed here |
| any "ready to demo" claim | full `uno-completeness-audit` → `docs/COMPLETENESS.md` | report saved |
| wave 8 | playtest acceptance (`PLAYTEST-SETUP.md`) | five-player session passes on the XAML build |

## Risks

- **R1 Hosting:** resolved in wave 0 (pointer-events workaround).
- **R2 Overlay:** resolved in wave 0. Open item: a JS `<dialog>` uses the browser top layer, so while one is
  open it covers the XAML too. Acceptable while panels migrate.
- **R3 CSS scope:** resolved in wave 0. Wave 1 adds `tests/test-scope-css.mjs` to keep it that way.
- **R4 Keys and focus:** resolved for `TextBox` in wave 0. Still to check in wave 1: a focused XAML button or
  list must not swallow or leak room keys.
- **R5 Motion:** the Toolkit drawer has no reduced-motion switch. Fallback: plain presenter.
- **R6 Fonts/text:** resolved in wave 0 for DM Sans; repeat the check for the other three files in wave 1.
- **R7 Size/build:** measured (+0.96 MB brotli, build time flat). Open: 20 trim warnings from Uno.Extensions/MVUX
  (see Unresolved Questions) and the Windows `--in-process` path.
- **R8 State volume:** full-state push measured too slow at max save size. Wave 1 pushes changed slices and
  re-measures the max save; target under 8 ms per push on the UI thread.
- **R9 Accounts:** the Turnstile widget inside a XAML dialog's `BrowserHtmlElement`, and Supabase
  session/redirect flows driven from C#. Wave 7 is gated on a 15-min spike; if it fails, the account panels
  stay JS dialogs.
- **R11 Screen readers on WASM native:** `AutomationProperties.Name` produced no `aria-label` in the Release
  build (Uno 6.7.135), and Tab revealed no "Enable accessibility" element (the docs describe that flow for the
  Skia renderer). Spike 15 min in wave 2; the names are already set in XAML so the fix is configuration.
- **R10 File import:** `FileOpenPicker` on WASM for save restore. Fallback: a JS file input in a small island.

## Unresolved Questions

- ~~Server path, new dependencies, trim warnings, standalone build~~ **Approved 2026-10-23:** staged server
  order; `Hosting; MVUX; Navigation; Toolkit` + four OFL fonts + xUnit project; gate on no warnings beyond
  the 20 recorded Extensions/MVUX trim warnings; retire the standalone `Afterhours.html` (the Uno app becomes
  the only client, solo play stays inside it). The packager and README mentions go in wave 8.
- **Substituted:** wardrobe preview tinting, synth/playhead/WAV export and arcade rounds stay JS behind
  interfaces. OK?
- **Omitted:** speech bubbles, arrival cues and the room intro card stay drawn on the canvas. OK?
- **Account panels** (wave 7) depend on R9; they stay JS dialogs if the spike fails. OK?
- **SurfaceRaisedBrush:** take it from the current card CSS in wave 1 (default)?
- **Phone layout:** bottom tab bar and full-screen flyouts below 700 px. Is the phone a playtest target?
- **Wave order:** catalog/inventory → studio/stage → wardrobe/profile/journal → rooms/room tools/companion/arcade →
  social → accounts. Change anything?
- **Spec location:** the root `SPEC.md` holds the shipped applause spec, so this one stays in `docs/specs/`. OK?
